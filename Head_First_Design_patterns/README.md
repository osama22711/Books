# OO Basics
* <span style="color: yellow">Composition</span> describes a class that refrences one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.
* <span style="color: yellow">Abstraction</span> is a general idea rather than one relating to a particular object, person, or situation.
* <span style="color: yellow">Encapsulation</span> is the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.
* <span style="color: yellow">Polymorphism</span> is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.
* <span style="color: yellow">Inheritance</span> is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class.
* <span style="color: yellow">Loose-coupling</span> in which components are weakly associated (have breakable relationship) with each other, and so, changes in one component least affect existence or performance of another component. Loose coupling is the opposite of <span style="color: orange">tight coupling</span>, Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

# OO principles
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

# OO Patterns
* <span style="color: yellow">The Strategy Pattern</span>: defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. [ We used it in <span style="color: orange">Testing Duck behaviors</span> application in chapter 1]
* <span style="color: yellow">The Observer Pattern</span>: defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# Bullet points
1. * Knowing the OO basics does not make you a good OO designer.
   * Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.
   * Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.
   * Patterns are proven object-oriented experience.
   * Patterns don't give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. You apply them to your specific application.
   * Patterns aren't invented, they are discovered.
   * Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.
   * Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.
   * We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.
   * Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developer.
